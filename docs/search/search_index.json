What \u00b6 3DC IAP Conference is a collation of related IAP activities to the SUTD community. It happened between 06 January - 23 January 2019 . Why \u00b6 All IAPS are currently conducted individually by separate parties, which are usually a series of talks / activities / workshops that encourage students to pursue their interests. Issues \u00b6 The IAPs may come in odd fashion with beginner events amongst the tougher events. Timings may clash which disallows students from successively attending multiple IAPs. IAP materials are sometimes not shared to the participants. How \u00b6 This IAP conference brings together IAP activities with the aim to widen the learning horizon and deepen the subject knowledge of the SUTD community by complementing the experiential learning component of a student\u2019s experience. The conference allows for the participation in meaningful exchange of ideas through diversified experiences and engagement in advanced technologies. It is also hoped that the centralized planning of IAP activities will lead to greater participation numbers in subsequent batches of SUTD students. Open Source Collaboration \u00b6 Organizers are invited to submit IAP proposals on the 3DC IAP Conference GitHub repository as issues. Potential organizers would be able to view the proposed activities, and adjust the contents of their activities accordingly. 3DC would handle majority of the administrative workload, which includes the submission of the IAP proposals to OSL as well as the scheduling of the IAP activities. In collaboration with OpenSUTD, the open organization owned by the SUTD community, organizers are encouraged to share their activities' resources by uploading them in OpenSUTD's GitHub organization, so that the entire SUTD community can benefit from them.","title":"3DC IAP Conference"},{"location":"3DC-IAP/#what","text":"3DC IAP Conference is a collation of related IAP activities to the SUTD community.

Markdown Editor \u00b6 StackEdit.io GitHub Gist For those of you without a Markdown editor installed, I recommend the usage of either Stackedit.io or GitHub Gist . Stackedit.io provides live preview of your Markdown syntax together with the formatted content, allowing one to update the Markdown syntax and view the changes instantly. As for GitHub Gist, live previews are provided in a separate tab for comments on GitHub. The actual gists do not allow for one to preview the formatting of the Markdown syntax. But it would be familiar to get used to the GitHub interface, as we would use it for the creation of the website later. Headers \u00b6 What you type What you get # This is an h1 tag ## This is an h2 tag ### This is an h3 tag #### This is an h4 tag ##### This is an h5 tag ###### This is an h6 tag Headers are written in Markdown syntax using the hash or pound sign ( # ). They are equivalent to the HTML headings from <h1> to <h6> , and widely used in Markdown documents as sectioning elements. Emphasis \u00b6 What you type What you get *This will be italic* This will be italic _This will also be italic_ This will also be italic **This will be bold** This will be bold __This will also be bold__ This will also be bold _You **can** combine them_ You can combine them Bold and italic text can be formatted in Markdown syntax using asterisks ( * ) or underscores ( _ ). 1 asterisk or underscore for italics , 2 asterisks or underscores for bold text . Markdown also allows the flexibility of combining bold and italic text together. Lists \u00b6 Unordered Lists \u00b6 What you type What you get For unordered lists, asterisks ( * ), hyphens ( - ) and pluses ( + ) can be used interchangeably as list markers. To begin an unordered list, use a list marker, followed by a space between the list marker and the list item. To create a unordered sublist within the unordered list, add 2 spaces followed by the list marker. Ordered Lists \u00b6 What you type What you get Ordered list begin with 1. , followed by a space between the ordinal marker and the list item. To create an ordered sublist with the ordered list, add 2 spaces followed by the ordinal sublist marker in lowercase Roman numerals ( i. ). Links \u00b6 What you type What you get https://github.com https://github.com [GitHub](http://github.com) GitHub In Markdown, web URLs are automatically recognized as rendered as hyperlinks. You can also customise the link text by enclosing it in square brackets [ ] and placing the actual URL in brackets ( ) after the square brackets. Images \u00b6 What you type What you get ![SUTD logo](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/assets/sutd/img/logo-black.png) Images written in Markdown syntax are similar to links, except that they begin with an exclamation mark ( ! ). The text in square brackets [ ] is the alternate text of the image and will be displayed when the image is unable to load. Tables \u00b6 What you type What you get To create tables in Markdown syntax, the cells in each row are separated by a vertical bar or pipe ( | ). A table will be generated once the second row of Markdown syntax is input. It consists of three hyphen characters ( --- ) for each cell separated by vertical bars ( | ) between each cell. Regular Markdown syntax applies within the table as well. Inline code \u00b6 What you type What you get I think you should use an `<addr>` element here instead. I think you should use an <addr> element here instead. Inline code snippets can be included by adding back-ticks ( ` ) around the code snippet. Indenting by 4 spaces will turn an entire paragraph into a code block. Syntax highlighting \u00b6 What you type What you get Markdown supports the syntax highlighting of keywords in programming languages. By enclosing the code block in 3 back-ticks ( ``` ) at the beginning and end of the code block and indicating the programming language after the initial 3 back-ticks, the syntax of the code will be highlighted as expected. Blockquotes \u00b6 What you type What you get > We're living the future so the present is our past. Blockquotes are typically used to reply in email and conversation threads, or otherwise highlight some key phrases. They can be written in Python by adding a right angle bracket ( > ) before the quote. Works with HTML \u00b6 Markdown insufficient? You can add HTML code into Markdown and it will still work. But take note NOT to mix Markdown syntax and HTML code together in a single line. It will not work.","title":"Markdown"},{"location":"markdown/#markdown","text":"Markdown is a lightweight markup language that: is very easy to pick up; can be converted into many file formats such as PDF, DOCX, EPUB, HTML, etc. using Pandoc ; can generate diagrams such as UML Sequence Diagrams, Flowcharts, Class and State Diagrams; can be used to create a static site, using the static generator MkDocs .","title":"Markdown"},{"location":"markdown/#markdown-editor","text":"StackEdit.io GitHub Gist For those of you without a Markdown editor installed, I recommend the usage of either Stackedit.io or GitHub Gist .
