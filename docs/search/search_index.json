What \u00b6 3DC IAP Conference is a collation of related IAP activities to the SUTD community. It happened between 06 January - 23 January 2019 . Why \u00b6 All IAPS are currently conducted individually by separate parties, which are usually a series of talks / activities / workshops that encourage students to pursue their interests. Issues \u00b6 The IAPs may come in odd fashion with beginner events amongst the tougher events. Timings may clash which disallows students from successively attending multiple IAPs. IAP materials are sometimes not shared to the participants. How \u00b6 This IAP conference brings together IAP activities with the aim to widen the learning horizon and deepen the subject knowledge of the SUTD community by complementing the experiential learning component of a student\u2019s experience. The conference allows for the participation in meaningful exchange of ideas through diversified experiences and engagement in advanced technologies. It is also hoped that the centralized planning of IAP activities will lead to greater participation numbers in subsequent batches of SUTD students. Open Source Collaboration \u00b6 Organizers are invited to submit IAP proposals on the 3DC IAP Conference GitHub repository as issues. Potential organizers would be able to view the proposed activities, and adjust the contents of their activities accordingly. 3DC would handle majority of the administrative workload, which includes the submission of the IAP proposals to OSL as well as the scheduling of the IAP activities. In collaboration with OpenSUTD, the open organization owned by the SUTD community, organizers are encouraged to share their activities' resources by uploading them in OpenSUTD's GitHub organization, so that the entire SUTD community can benefit from them.","title":"3DC IAP Conference"},{"location":"3DC-IAP/#what","text":"3DC IAP Conference is a collation of related IAP activities to the SUTD community.

What \u00b6 OpenSUTD began as a movement in April 2018. The original mission of OpenSUTD was to develop a culture of design-driven policy solutioning and collaboration in the SUTD community . Why \u00b6 We wanted to be different. We all joined SUTD excited to be part of a world-class, collaborative community of learners, innovators, and explorers. As the University grew, it became more organizational, more hierarchical. Somewhere along the way, I\u2019d seen even the best and brightest lose their spark; jaded, exhausted, and tired for a number of reasons. We lost some of the best people. @joel , ISTD Class of '19 Back in 2018, Joel started a simple repository on GitHub. The idea was for students to collaborate and share knowledge with each other on a public platform. How \u00b6 GitHub was chosen as the primary platform for OpenSUTD as an open organisation. The reasons for choosing GitHub are as follows: Allows team formation Models that of a loosely aligned organisation, we simply fork repositories and maintain them with \u2018fork bot\u2019. Functionalities that greatly lowered the technical debt. eg. static site hosting, apps. Projects \u00b6 Open regulation of SAC \u00b6 OpenSUTD has taken over management of the Student Activities Centre (SAC). The rules and regulations of the SAC can be found here . Fifth row guides \u00b6 To pass on knowledge between batches of Fifth Row leaders, OpenSUTD has documented the pulsecheck process and finance guidelines . Course notes \u00b6 OpenSUTD has built a GitHub repository where SUTD students can freely share notes on SUTD's modules.
